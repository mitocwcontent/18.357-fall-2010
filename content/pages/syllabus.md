Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 90 min / session

Prerequisites
-------------

_18.354J Nonlinear Dynamics II: Continuum Systems_; _18.355 Fluid Mechanics_; and [_12.800 Fluid Dynamics of the Atmosphere and Ocean_](/courses/12-800-fluid-dynamics-of-the-atmosphere-and-ocean-fall-2004), or [_2.25 Fluid Mechanics_](/courses/2-25-advanced-fluid-mechanics-fall-2013).

Description
-----------

This graduate-level course covers fluid systems dominated by the influence of interfacial tension. The roles of curvature pressure and Marangoni stress are elucidated in a variety of fluid systems. Particular attention is given to drops and bubbles, soap films and minimal surfaces, wetting phenomena, water-repellency, surfactants, Marangoni flows, capillary origami and contact line dynamics.

Textbook
--------

There is no required text for the course, which will be based on the lecture notes. However, the following are recommended supporting material.

Gennes, Pierre-Gilles de, Françoise Brochard-Wyart, and David Quéré. _Capillarity and Wetting Phenomena: Drops, Bubbles, Pearls, Waves_. Springer, 2003. ISBN: 9780387005928.

A readable and accessible treatment of a wide range of capillary phenomena.

Homsy, G. M. _Multimedia Fluid Mechanics_. Cengage Learning, 2011. ISBN: 9780521721691.

A DVD with an extensive section devoted to capillary effects.
